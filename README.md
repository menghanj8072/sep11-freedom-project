# SEP11 Freedom Project
by MengHan Jiang

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about learning and exploring new tools that will be useful for our project idea. The purpose of this blog is to show my process from beginning to the final product.

## Content
For my project, I am making a game using KaboomJS. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying of KaboomJs in order to make my final product.

## Implications
My freedom project is a game similar to the game of hungry shark. This game has a friendly environment and its suitable for any age. It also includes some positive impact on society. If someone ever felt bored, they can try this new game out. It will help reduce their loneliness or boredom. They can also improve their relationships with their friends by competing the score they got. Overall, this is a friendly game that is available for everyone.
