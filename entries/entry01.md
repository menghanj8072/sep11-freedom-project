# Entry 1 Deciding on a tool
##### 11/8/2022

  For this year’s freedom project we have to use JavaScript to make something. I am choosing **[Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/)** as my freedom project tool. Before I made a final decision for my freedom project tool, I chose **[Threejs](https://threejs.org/)**. At first I wanted to create a 3D adventure game using threejs, but then after trying it out and doing some research on google and youtube, I found out that threejs is only good for making 3D animations for websites. But my goal was to make a game, so then I decided to change to Kaboomjs and also changed my idea for what I want to make. My new idea was to make a game similar to flappy bird using Kaboomjs. Some websites that I explored helped me decide on why to choose Kaboomjs were [How to Use Kaboom.js to Make Video Games](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/kaboom-js/), [Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/), and [Kaboomjs tutorial](https://gamedevacademy.org/kaboom-js-tutorials/).
  
  Right now I’m currently in stage **2 researching the problem** and **3 brainstorming possible solutions** in the engineering design process. My goal was to research about my freedom project tool and brainstorming an idea for what I want to make with my tool, which I already did. In addition, I learned a new skill which is **“How to Learn”**. The reason why I said that was because right now I am learning a new tool on my own. I learned by following tutorials and tinkering to help me understand how Kaboomjs works.
