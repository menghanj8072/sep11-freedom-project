During the winter break, I have found a new tutorial to follow. The tutorial was about making Flappy Bird Game in Kaboom Js. In order for me to begin the tutorial, I have to make a new project first in replit. After doing that I begin downloading the sprites and assest files that I will need for making the Flappy Bird Game. The first step in the tutorial was to import the sprites and sound by using `loadSprite()` and `loadSound()`. Then I begin adding scenes to the game. Scenes are like different stages in Kaboom. As mention in the tutorial, the Flappy Bird Game has 3 scenes: start, main game, and end. So I follow the steps and created the scene by doing:
```JS
scene("game", () => {
});

scene("gameover", (score) => {
});

go("game");
```
Then I moved on to the next step which is to build the game world. What that means is that to add the background and the main sprite "flappy bird" into the game.
