In previous blog, I talked about finish following the Flappy Bird tutorial and starting building my MVP for my freedom project. After that I didn't research for another tutorial to follow because I have to focus on the MVP. My idea for my freedom project was to build a game similar to flappy bird. However, as Im working on it the result didn't turn out to be what I wanted. So I changed my idea to make a fish eat fish game.
