# Entry 6
##### 5/25/2023

Now we have reached the end of the year in SEP11, we are giving presentations about our year-long project. My project was a game made using javascript game programming library: Kaboom. Throughout the year, I have been researching tutorials to learn Kaboom in order to make my game. Now that I'm finished with my game, I'm going to present it in my class as well as in EXPO. In EXPO, there will be judges and they will rate our presentation and project. To prepare for the EXPO presentation we were told from our teacher to write an elevator pitch script. This is same what we did last year in SEP10. Elevator pitch script is a short script of what you will be saying to the judges. Here is my elevator pitch script:

```
Hi, would you like to try out the game that I made?
My game is similar to the game of hungry shark, where you have to avoid the bomb and to eat fish to get points. 
I made this game using kaboom. If you don’t know what kaboom is, Kaboom is a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun. 
For this game all you have to do is to press the spacebar to jump. You can also read the instructions here in case you forgot.
This is the link to my game, if you want to try out again later.

(Here is my code if you want to see it)
(Do you have any questions?)
```
During the EXPO, I have received many positive feedbacks about my game. Most of the feedbacks were ideas of how I can make my game even better. My takeaway from the EXPO presentation is to show the judge the process of making the project. Showing codes allows judge to understand how you made your project. For my in class presentation, we don't have judges. Our teacher Mr.Mueller is the one who will rate our presentation and project. I have made google slide for my presentation. [This is my slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-w2vGD2DQpte47OWSo3JkwgT690Y3U3nplCrG-dxNtw/edit#slide=id.p). I have received a perfect score for my project, but not for my presentation. I have received feedbacks from my teacher that I need to improve on speaking louder and have eye contact with the audiences. My takeaway would the the feedbacks that my teacher gave me: speaking louder and have eye contact with the audiences.

This is the last year in SEP course, and right now I’m in stage **8 Communicate the result** in the **engineering design process**. I finished my year-long project and presented it in class and in EXPO. I received many feedbacks from sharing my year-long project. One new skill I learned was **“Communication”**. This is the new skill I learned because as I was presentating my project, I communicated with people to get more ideas of how I should improve my project or how I should improve my presentation.
